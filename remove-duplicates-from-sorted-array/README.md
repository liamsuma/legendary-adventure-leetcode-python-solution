# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

# Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2] 

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
